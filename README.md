# Extensible Robotic Beamline Scientist

Project repository for building extensible robotic beamline scientists at NSLS-II.

## Contents

The majority of the contents in this repository are ROS2 packages with associated continer image manifests.
Each manifest in the [docker](./docker) directory is a container image that can be used to run a specific application in the system.

- [aruco_pose](./src/aruco_pose): ROS2 package for detecting ArUco markers and calculating their pose.
- [pdf](./src/pdf): Source directory for PDF beamline specific applications.
  - [pdf_beamtime](./src/pdf/pdf_beamtime): ROS2 package for controlling the UR3e robot arm and HandE gripper at the PDF beamline.
  - [pdf_beamtime_interfaces](./src/pdf/pdf_beamtime_interfaces): ROS2 package for defining the interfaces used in the pdf_beamtime package.
- [cms](./src/cms): Source directory for CMS beamline specific applications. (Currently placeholder)
- [lix](./src/lix): Source directory for LIX beamline specific applications. (Currently placeholder)
- [demos](./src/demos): Source directory for demonstration applications.
  - [hello_moveit](./src/demos/hello_moveit): ROS2 package for demonstrating simple actions using the MoveIt library with the UR3e robot arm.
  - [hello_moveit_interfaces](./src/demos/hello_moveit_interfaces): ROS2 package for defining the interfaces used in the hello_moveit package.


### Docker Contents

We use Podman throughout this work, but have named the container images with Docker in mind.

- [erobs-common-img](./docker/erobs-common-img): Common container image for running the majority of applications herein, including: UR robot driver, gripper service, MoveIt service, and the pdf_beamtime_server (primary `Action` server).
- [bsui](./docker/bsui): Container image for running the Bluesky User Interface with mounts at NSLS-II.
- [azure-kinect](./docker/azure-kinect): Container image for running the Azure Kinect ROS2 driver.
- Other auxiliary container images that are not used in the main application, but are useful for development and testing:
  - [ursim](./docker/ursim): Container image for running a simulated UR3e robot arm with a teach pendant.
  - [ur-driver](./docker/ur-driver): Container image for running the UR3e robot arm ROS2 driver.
  - [ur-moveit](./docker/ur-moveit): Container image for running MoveIt with the UR3e robot arm.
  - [ur-example](./docker/ur-example): Container image for running a simple action with the UR3e robot arm.
  - [erobs-hello-moveit](./docker/erobs-hello-moveit): Container image for running a simple action with the UR3e robot arm.


### Hello Moveit

Demonstrations using a combination of the MoveIt tutorials and some UR specific tools, to show how to make simple actions
that can deploy MoveIt using the MoveGroupInterface.

### Bluesky ROS

Ongoing developments of integrating ROS2 and Bluesky. Currently targeted towards integrating Ophyd Objects as ROS2 Action Clients.

## Using Containers to Run the Full Applicaiton Suite

The complete application uses a 1-node-per-container model. The containers are currently orchestrated by bash scripts detailed in the READMEs of each container image. Specifically, the full application is detailed in [erobs-common-img](./docker/erobs-common-img/README.md).

## Running some example applications

In order to run the `ur-example` with Docker, follow this procedure:

1. Create the required images.

  ```bash
  cd docker
  docker build -t ursim:latest ./ursim
  docker build -t ur-driver:latest ./ur-driver
  docker build -t ur-example:latest ./ur-example
  ```

2. Start the UR Simulator. In a new terminal, run

  ```bash
  docker compose up ursim
  ```

3. Open VNC client at `localhost:5900`.
4. Turn on and start the robot.
5. Go to the `Move` tab and click the `Home` button.
6. Press and hold the `Move robot to: New position` button to move the robot into position. Press `Continue`.
7. Verify the joint position is `[0, -90, 0, -90, 0, 0]` degrees.
8. Note: setting initial position is requried for the `ur-example` to start, as specified in the `test_goal_publisher_config.yaml` file in the official Unviersal_Robots_ROS2_Driver repo.

9. Start the ur-driver. In a new terminal, run

  ```bash
  docker compose up urdriver
  ```

Now, go back to the VNC client. In the `Program` tab, start the program.

10. Run the ur-example. In a new terminal, run

  ```bash
  docker compose up urexample
  ```

The in `Program/Graphics` tab, the robot should be moving between four poses every 6 seconds.

## Notes on VSCode Workspace

VSCode ROS2 Workspace Template Borrowed from @althack.

This template will get you set up using ROS2 with VSCode as your IDE. And help ensure consistent development across the project.

See [how she develops with vscode and ros2](https://www.allisonthackston.com/articles/vscode_docker_ros2.html) for a more in-depth look on how to use this workspace.

ROS2-approved formatters are included in the IDE.

- **c++** uncrustify; config from `ament_uncrustify`
- **python** autopep8; vscode settings consistent with the [style guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Code-Style-Language-Versions/)

## Notes on pdf_beamtime and its tests

pdf_beamtime is a work-in-progress package aiming to deploy the UR3e robot arm + HandE gripper at the PDF beamline.
This package depends on pdf_beamtime_interfaces. Follow the link below for information on the package and for the commands to call the servers implemented in the package.
